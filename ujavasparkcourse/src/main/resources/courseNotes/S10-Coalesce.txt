Section 10 - Coalesce

Coalesce - combines data from all partitions into a single partition
 
combine all data into single partition
*Not the right solution

sorted = sorted.coalesce(1);

Get number of partitions
	sorted.getNumPartitions()
	
Problem is Spark Driver would sent foreach command to execute the 
lambda on each partition in parallel.

Call any action other than foreach.  They will be implemented to give correct
results (but be mindful of performance).

collect() is generally used when you've finished and you want to gather a small
RDD onto the driver node for eg printing.

Only call if you're sure the RDD will fit into a single JVM's RAM

If the results are still "big", we'd write to a file (eg - HDFS)
